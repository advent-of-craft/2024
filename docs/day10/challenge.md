## Day 10: Fix a bug.

Santa came to the office this morning with a long face. He did not seem happy even after a festive night.
Looking at Teo's straight face, something was off...

One release went wrong yesterday apparently. Maybe it was related to that.

In order to deliver the presents, Santa uses the navigation system designed by the elves.

The system seems to be buggy... one test is now failing and is blocking the release.

Please fix the bug so the release can go on ðŸŽ…
