## Day 16: Bug bounty.

Elves are using their own `Task assignment system` in order to share the workload fairly according to each person's skills.
One of them has observed a problem with it... he suspects that the system contains bugs.

He shared his observations with you:

Oh, dear! It seems our Task Assignment System has gone a bit haywire, and I, Elf Bob, am here to explain the mess we've found ourselves in. 
You see, we elves have been using this system to manage our tasks and skill levels, but something's not quite right.

Let me give you some examples of the mess we've been dealing with when it comes to task assignments and our skill levels.

Imagine we have three elves: Alice, Bob, and Charlie. 
Alice has a skill level of 7, Bob has a skill level of 5, and Charlie has a skill level of 3. 

Now, let's say we have a task that requires a skill level of 4.
You'd think that Alice and Bob would both be capable of doing this task, right? 

But sometimes, our Task Assignment System only assigns the task to Alice and completely overlooks Bob! 
It's like the system is completely ignoring our skill levels and just assigning tasks randomly.

Sometimes, when a task is reassigned from one elf to another, the second elf suddenly gains the same skill level as the first elf! 
It's like the system thinks we can magically learn new skills just by taking on a task. 
I wish it were that easy, but unfortunately, it's not.
 
As you can see, our Task Assignment System has been causing quite a bit of confusion and chaos. 
We're doing our best to work around the issues, but it's not easy. 
We could really use some help to get the system back on track and make sure we're all assigned the right tasks based on our skills. 
After all, we've got a lot of work to do before Christmas, and we can't afford any more mix-ups!
```
