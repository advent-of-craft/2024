## Day 23: Emergency before Christmas.
> Issue with the Santa's Sleigh Dashboard system

Santa has just one day to ramp up for Christmas and unfortunately, Dasher and Comet, the two leading deer got sick yesterday. This significantly influence the ability for the sleigh to fly.

### The background

Teo, the leading Elf tech lead is tasking you to help him figuring out what's wrong with the sleigh. He tells you, the sleigh is not flying because some deers are sick and it never happened before...

Santa's sleigh, powered by reindeers, is controlled through a dashboard that manages its ascent, descent, and parking. The existing codebase for the sleigh's control system is poorly structured and lacks comprehensive testing, leading to unstable behavior.

### What you can do

Santa has 9 reindeers to power up the sleigh through the control system and each deer can have an amplifier to help the sleigh flying.

### The challenge

You will start with a significant code base and will have few tests to figure out what is wrong.
You are not allowed to change the Reindeer class and attributes but you can play with the rest of the system.

Read the notice of the sleigh system [here](./notice.md)

You can use all the craft you learned since you arrived to bulk up the testing suite and add the necessary adjustment for the sleigh to work.

âœ…ðŸš€ **Challenge: make sure the sleigh can fly to insure Christmas happen!** ðŸš€âœ…

HINT: Make sure you read the notice before you ship your changes.
