## Day 14: Find a more efficient way to test object mappings.

To organize his tour Santa maintains a database containing all the children in the world.

All their information is stored in a very old legacy system: `db2`.

Because the data is stored in a really cryptic way, the elves have developed a mapping feature to expose data in a more readable way.

It is a critical feature and we must be sure that any changes to those entities won't break any mapping...

✅🚀 **Challenge: Find a better / more efficient way to test this mapping.** 🚀✅

 ⚠️ WARNING: You guarantee that any property addition or removal will be detected from tests.
