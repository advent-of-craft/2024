## Day 11: Secure the program.

Santa and his elves are preparing the Christmas Delivery.
Last year, they had some problems to categorize the packages and some mistakes have been made.

This year they would like to be sure that they can count on the program they use to:
- Split gift preparation
- Categorize the gifts
- Ensure toy balance

They have added a lot of `Unit Tests` to do so.

Help them to ensure that they won't have any problems with that program 🎅🧝.

✅🚀 **Challenge: Ensure the program is 100% safe.** 🚀✅
