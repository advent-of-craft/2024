## Day 1: Too many parameters...

The first system you get a crack on is the communication piece.
Santa developped a system to broadcast messages to his reindeers as well as to find out who could be potentially late for Christmas. ðŸ¦ŒðŸ«Ž

He is not completely happy with the implementation as he famously made a couple of mistakes using it by inverting 2 integers when calling the `composeMessage` method...

That year, Teo had to fix it to manually send messages so the reindeers arrived the very day before Chritmas happened! ðŸ“£

What could you do to help him? 

Let's try to make sure the code is more explicit.

âœ…ðŸš€ **Challenge: Reduce the number of parameters in the public methods** ðŸš€âœ…

- <u>ðŸ’¡HINT:</u> Are primitives always a good idea?
